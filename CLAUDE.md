- ✅ Free-form AI conversation practice for natural dialogue
- ✅ AI analyzes conversations and suggests relevant vocabulary to add based on user struggles or knowledge gaps
- ✅ Simple, focused integration between vocabulary management and conversation features

#### What the App Will NOT Do:

- ❌ Grammar/writing correction focus
- ❌ Structured course curriculum with lessons/modules
- ❌ Separate disconnected vocabulary and conversation systems
- ❌ Vocabulary-forced conversations (AI creating conversations around specific words)
- ❌ Overly complex bidirectional AI systems

### Current Requirements Discussion (August 5-7, 2025)

#### Finalized Requirements

##### Learning Objectives

- **Target Level**: B2 English proficiency

## Technical Architecture - FINALIZED ✅ (August 7, 2025)

### Data Storage Strategy

**Conversation Data Approach**: Store meaningful learning data rather than raw transcripts

- ✅ **Conversation Flow**: Topic progression + Linguistic complexity analysis
- ✅ **Skills Assessment**: Accuracy metrics (grammar, vocabulary appropriateness, sentence complexity) + Fluency indicators (conversation flow smoothness, response timing, natural phrase usage)
- ✅ **Vocabulary Suggestions**: Contextual storage with conversation context where words were identified

### Complete Database Schema

**Legacy Tables** (from original requirements):

```sql
-- Core user management
users: id, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at

-- User vocabulary collection
words: id, user_id, word, meaning, translation, category, part_of_speech, phonetic, example, created_at, updated_at

-- Vocabulary categories
categories: id, user_id, name, description, created_at
```

**New AI Conversation Tables**:

```sql
-- Conversation sessions
conversation_sessions: id, user_id, started_at, ended_at, duration_minutes

-- Topic progression tracking (conversation flow)
conversation_topics: id, session_id, topic, order_sequence, complexity_level, created_at

-- Linguistic complexity analysis (conversation flow)
linguistic_analysis: id, session_id, avg_sentence_length, vocabulary_level, grammar_complexity, created_at

-- Skills assessment (accuracy & fluency metrics)
skills_assessments: id, session_id, grammar_accuracy_score, vocabulary_appropriateness_score, sentence_complexity_score, flow_smoothness_score, response_timing_avg, natural_phrase_usage_score, created_at

-- Contextual vocabulary suggestions
vocabulary_suggestions: id, session_id, suggested_word, user_word_used, conversation_context, suggestion_reason, status, created_at
```

### Data Architecture Decisions

**What We Store**:

- ✅ Conversation flow patterns and topic progression
- ✅ Linguistic complexity metrics for learning assessment
- ✅ Vocabulary suggestions with conversation context
- ✅ Skills assessment scores (accuracy + fluency)

**What We Don't Store**:

- ❌ Complete conversation transcripts (privacy + storage efficiency)
- ❌ Interaction patterns or engagement metrics (not essential for B2 learning)
- ❌ Abstract skill categories or language functions (too complex for MVP)

vocabulary_suggestions(id, session_id, suggested_word, user_word_used, conversation_context, suggestion_reason, status, created_at)
```

### API Architecture Strategy

**Phase 1 (Next.js API Routes)**:

- OpenAPI contract definition from day one
- Provider interface for swappable AI models (Gemini → Local → Premium)
- JWT-based authentication with Auth.js
- Prisma ORM with excellent Next.js integration

**Phase 2 (Rust Migration)**:

- Implement identical API contracts in Axum
- Reuse same Neon PostgreSQL database
- Frontend changes only API base URL via environment variable
- Gradual endpoint migration (start with conversation API)

**Caching Strategy**:

To manage API costs and improve response times, especially for AI-related endpoints, a two-phase caching strategy will be implemented.

- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: **In-memory cache** using a simple `Map` object within the API route.
  - **Pros**: Zero cost, extremely fast, easy to implement for development.
  - **Cons**: Not persistent (cache is lost on server restart) and not shared across serverless instances. Suitable for initial development and testing.
- **Phase 2 (Production/Scale)**: **Vercel KV (Redis)** for a robust, persistent cache.
  - **Pros**: High performance, data persistence, and shared across all serverless functions, making it ideal for production.
  - **Cons**: Introduces a managed service dependency.

### AI Provider Evolution Strategy

- **Phase 1**: Gemini free tier (MVP)
- **Phase 2**: Local LLM option (offline/zero-cost)
- **Phase 3**: Premium APIs (GPT/Claude high-quality)
- **All providers**: Same response format, UI unchanged
